[Joanne K](https://github.com/pixelbutter/)'s [medium article](https://medium.com/@joannekao/android-working-with-themes-and-styles-18cde717f4d) brillantly showcased how to do themes right on Android. This repo is a [copy of hers](https://github.com/pixelbutter/theme-sample), however with updates to better support certain widgets. I've too added a catalog of widgets to showcase the widgets in action.

## Note 
Android AppCompat is no longer preferred in usage, intead Material is. An equivalent repo to this for Material would be [Google's.](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android)
