## Enter Theming
I found a lot of wrong ways to do theming in Android. Joanne Kao's [Medium article](https://medium.com/@joannekao/android-working-with-themes-and-styles-18cde717f4d) however, brillantly showcases the right way. Android essentially allows you to set a number of [colors](https://chromium.googlesource.com/android_tools/+/25d57ead05d3dfef26e9c19b13ed10b0a69829cf/sdk/platforms/android-23/data/res/values/themes.xml) in a theme that are automatically applied to all widgets app wide for you. <br>

Alongside the article, Kao provided a [complimentary repo](https://github.com/pixelbutter/theme-sample). This repo is a copy of that plus updates to better support widgets. Too added is a catalog of widgets to futher showcase themes in action. Included are 3 themes: <br><br>
### Illini:<br><br>

## Note 
Android AppCompat is no longer preferred in usage, intead Material is. An equivalent repo that show cases themes & widgets in action for Material would be [Google's.](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android)
